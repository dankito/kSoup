/**
 * The Connection interface is a convenient HTTP client and session object to fetch content from the web, and parse them
 * into Documents.
 *
 * To start a new session, use either [net.dankito.ksoup.Jsoup.newSession] or [net.dankito.ksoup.Jsoup.connect].
 * Connections contain [Connection.Request] and [Connection.Response] objects (once executed). Configuration
 * settings (URL, timeout, useragent, etc) set on a session will be applied by default to each subsequent request.
 *
 * To start a new request from the session, use [.newRequest].
 *
 * Cookies are stored in memory for the duration of the session. For that reason, do not use one single session for all
 * requests in a long-lived application, or you are likely to run out of memory, unless care is taken to clean up the
 * cookie store. The cookie store for the session is available via [.cookieStore]. You may provide your own
 * implementation via [.cookieStore] before making requests.
 *
 * Request configuration can be made using either the shortcut methods in Connection (e.g. [.userAgent]),
 * or by methods in the Connection.Request object directly. All request configuration must be made before the request is
 * executed. When used as an ongoing session, initialize all defaults prior to making multi-threaded [.newRequest]s.
 *
 * Note that the term "Connection" used here does not mean that a long-lived connection is held against a server for
 * the lifetime of the Connection object. A socket connection is only made at the point of request execution ([.execute], [.get], or [.post]), and the server's response consumed.
 *
 * For multi-threaded implementations, it is important to use a [.newRequest] for each request. The session may
 * be shared across threads but a given request, not.
